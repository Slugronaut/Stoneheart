# Stoneheart
An ECS-based game engine and in-browser editor developed in Javascript.

This was a small project I used to get myself familiar with the basics of Javascript. Along the way I learned many things including:
* How much worse javascript is for most tasks that traditionally were done with any other programming language in the entire world until five years ago
* How hard it is to implement basic functionality in javascript that other languages support by default
* How bad the vast majority of javascript documentation is because it is aimed at non-programmers that spend more time consuimg non-dairy products that actually writing functionally useful code
* How the few useful features of javascript are generally frowned upong because it requires you to understand a thing or two about a thing or two

# Features
* Poorly optimized non-archetypal ECS-based solution
* Hacked-together type system to make it feel less like you are working javascript
* Simple two-way databinding model that allows for ease of editing components via UI elements (literally the only part about this where javascript was actually useful)
* Built-in scene editor that can be used in-broweser. Just press 'P' and 'O' keys at the same time to enable it
* Entity serialization allowing entities and their component states to be saved or loaded as textfiles
* Multi-layer rendering system
* Particle systems
* Basic collision and gravity
* Basic sprite animation
* Simple input for keyboard and gamepad
* Simple 2D platformer-style character controller
* Able to be extended by adding new systems and components
* Engine is able to be extended via components and systems
